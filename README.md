# Food-Pairing-On-User-Dietary-Restriction 

# Problem Statement
  In a world of diverse ingredients and dietary considerations, individuals often face
  challenges in selecting food pairings that cater to their preferences and restrictions. The
  abundance of options and complexities make this process overwhelming and
  time-consuming.

  Our project addresses this issue by implementing a solution that utilizes computational
  gastronomy techniques to offer personalized food pairing suggestions. By combining
  content-based filtering and natural language processing, we strive to simplify the
  decision-making process for individuals seeking tailored culinary experiences that align
  with their ingredient preferences and dietary restrictions.
