# Food-Pairing-On-User-Dietary-Restriction 

## Problem Statement
  In a world of diverse ingredients and dietary considerations, individuals often face
  challenges in selecting food pairings that cater to their preferences and restrictions. The
  abundance of options and complexities make this process overwhelming and
  time-consuming.

  Our project addresses this issue by implementing a solution that utilizes computational
  gastronomy techniques to offer personalized food pairing suggestions. By combining
  content-based filtering and natural language processing, we strive to simplify the
  decision-making process for individuals seeking tailored culinary experiences that align
  with their ingredient preferences and dietary restrictions. 

## Approach
  1. Our hybrid approach integrates content-based filtering and natural language processing
  (NLP) techniques to offer a robust and dynamic food pairing recommendation system.

  2. Primary goal is to elevate the precision and customization of food recommendations and
  aims to ensure that users receive suggestions aligned with their distinct preferences and
  dietary needs.

  3. Ensures that recommendations are aligned precisely with the user's specific requirements
  & Guarantees that dietary constraints and flavor preferences are fully considered.

  4. Goes beyond meeting user needs and introduces novelty and excitement & Enriches
  culinary exploration by suggesting innovative and enjoyable pairings.

  5. Embraces a comprehensive strategy that incorporates various aspects of data analysis &
  Delivers well-rounded recommendations that are informative and enticing.
